May be revived and completed with that goal.
May be expanded to other "stress testing" methods and interesting actions.
Not a slack raid toolkit... yet.

Growing (Hack Club) Slack's largest thread.
Can we hit one billion messages?



### Credits:
[https://github.com/taciturnaxolotl/spambot](https://github.com/taciturnaxolotl/spambot) - The original spambot, grew the thread to 1 Million +  messages. Borrowed app manifest, channel ID and thread_ts from here.
